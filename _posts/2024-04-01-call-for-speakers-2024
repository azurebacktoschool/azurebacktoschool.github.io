## **2024 Call for Speakers/Presenters**

Azure Back to School is back again this year.  Last year, we had over 70 participants to have 2-3 presentations daily for all 30 days of September.  I'd like to have twice this many this year.  Submit your sessions between 1 April 2024 and 30 June 2024.  Sessions can be videos or blog articles.  Sessions should have something actionable that the viewers can learn and execute on their own.  

Submit your session here: <https://sessionize.com/azure-back-to-school-2024/>


Schedule and New Website Coming Soon!!!
